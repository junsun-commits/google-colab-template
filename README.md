# CryoDRGN

Please check [`template.ipynb`](template.ipynb).
CryoDRGN is a Cryo-EM neural network-based method for heterogeneous reconstruction. Conventional methods for dealing heterogeneity uses descrete K means clustering. Instead, CryoDRGN learns a generative model for heterogeneous reconstruction giving a continuous distribution of density maps parameterized by a coordinate-based neural network.
